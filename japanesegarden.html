            <h2>Breathtaking view</h2>
            <p>
                The Japanese Garden has a unique and special atmosphere. 
                This is due in part to the beautiful moss cover. 
                There are also beautiful and rare plants and trees in the garden. 
                In the spring you can admire the azaleas, rhododendrons and Japanese
                cherry blossom trees. During the autumn the garden is exceptionally
                colourful with the autumn hues of the different Japanese maple trees. 
                Do you wish to come and experience it yourself. <a href="https://www.denhaag.nl/en/nature-and-environment/japanese-garden-in-clingendael-park/">well follow us and see when its open!</a>
